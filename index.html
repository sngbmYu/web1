		<h2>WEB</h2>
		<p>
			The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
			where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
			Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
			hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are
			transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by
			users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a
			software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous
			with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades
			and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
